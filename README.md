# Marker, Annotation Extension

Marker is a Chrome extension that lets you annotate any webpage with text formatting and freehand drawings. Your annotations are automatically saved and restored when you revisit the page.

## Features

### Text Annotations
Select any text on a webpage to apply formatting styles including **underline**, **bold**, and **strikethrough**. Simply highlight the text you want to annotate and choose your desired style from the popup toolbar. Click a style again to remove it. All text annotations persist across browser sessions.

### Freehand Drawing
Switch to Draw mode to sketch directly on any webpage. Choose from multiple colors and adjust the brush size to suit your needs. An eraser tool lets you remove individual strokes, and you can clear all drawings at once if needed.

### Automatic Saving
All annotations are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. When you return to a page you've annotated, your highlights and drawings are restored exactly as you left them. Use the reset button to clear all annotations from a page when you're done.
